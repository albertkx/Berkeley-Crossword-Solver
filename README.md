This branch contains the source code for the Dr.Fill system which won the ACPT 2021. The version provided here includes the code for adding the scores from the BCS question answering model (in score.cpp and berkeley.cpp). After the victory at the 2021 ACPT, the original Dr.Fill was retired. This code is provided for educational purposes as there is required data that cannot be released. Matt Ginsberg is not in a position to provide assistance with it.
