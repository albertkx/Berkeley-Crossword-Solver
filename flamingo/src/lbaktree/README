1) Running the code: in the lbaktree directory, type "cmake ." and then "make" to compile the code. Run the compiled example in the "build" directory.

2) Data and queries files: the files should use the following format:
    a. each line represents one record/query
    b. each record consists of latitude and longitude separated
    by a white space, note that you can modify the unittest.cc code to accept rectangular records instead of points.
    c. each query is a rectangle with two points
    c. the coordinates are followed by a comma, and then the keywords
    d. the keywords are separated by a white space
   Here is an example of a record:
   42.3631 -71.065, all phase plumbing
   Here is an example of a query:
   55.9551 -159.067 56.5551 -158.467, chignik school
