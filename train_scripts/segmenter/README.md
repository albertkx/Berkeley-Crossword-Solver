# Segmenter

This is a GPT-2 language model which takes as input the all caps fill (e.g., BUZZLIGHTYEAR) and segments it into individual words (e.g., Buzz Lightyear). See the generate.py script for example usage.

## Training
To train the model. Clone transformers and git reset hard to a75c64d80c76c3dc71f735d9197a4a601847e0cd. Then overwrite the `run_language_modeling.py` script with the script inside this folder. Then you can install that version of huggingface. Make sure to reinstall the latest version to run the rest of the code.

The data is generated by taking Wikipedia titles and uppercasing them and removing spaces and punctuation. We also add in common unigrams, bigrams, and trigams that occur at least 25 times on Wikipedia and "common sayings" using NLTK.
